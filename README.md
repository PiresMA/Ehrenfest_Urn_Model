# Ehrenfest_Urn_Model
Basic Ehrenfest model: consider two urns A and B and a certain number N of balls numbered from 1 to N. Initially, the balls are placed on urn A. Next, one of the balls is chosen at random and transferred to the other urn. This procedure is then repeated at each time step. In the long time the Ehrenfest model approaches equilibrium. This model can be interpreted as a toy model of: (i) heat exchange between two bodies (ii) diffusion of gases between two chambers. For a interesting and recent generalization see [4].
