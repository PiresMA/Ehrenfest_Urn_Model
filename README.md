# Ehrenfest_Urn_Model

##  Basic Ehrenfest model
Consider two urns A and B and a certain number N of balls numbered from 1 to N. Initially, the balls are placed on urn A. Next, one of the balls is chosen at random and transferred to the other urn. This procedure is then repeated at each time step. In the long time the Ehrenfest model approaches equilibrium. 

## Applications
This model has been employed as a platform for testing key concepts of statistical physics and related fields. Apart from this, it can be interpreted as a toy model of: (i) heat exchange between two bodies (ii) diffusion of gases between two chambers. Some interesting generalizations can be found in [4-9].
